# emilia_coding_challenge
An empty JavaScript project with Jest

## Setup
If you don't have yarn installed locally, install it first by running e.g.:
```
npm install --global yarn
```

## Tests
This empty project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for tests

To run all tests use the following command:

```
yarn test
```

The test files are named as their corresponding source files but with the suffix `*.spec.js`.

E.g. `app.js` is the source file and its test file is named `app.spec.js`

## Running the App
For this coding challenge it's enough that the app is running in the terminal. So to run the app use Node.
[Here](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/run-nodejs-scripts-from-the-command-line/) are the docs to run your app in terminal by using Node.
