An empty Javascript project with Jest

## Tests
This empty project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for tests

To run all tests use the following command:

```
npm test
```

The test files are named as their corresponding source files but with the suffix `*.spec.js`.

E.g. `app.js` is the source file and its test file is named `app.spec.js`
